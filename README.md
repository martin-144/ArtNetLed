WS2812 Led Stripe controlled by a ESP2866 over ArtNet
WS2812 Torch I created for a theatre performance, LED stripes wound around a wood stick making a torch effect.
Still in work. But quite mature now.

Picked up working on this again. Same theatre performance. 10 Years later.
Needed to upgrade many of the PlatformIO library versions. Done it locally. First see if it works.
